    <h2 style="color: #ff6ec7;">Complex Concept: Nuclear Reactions and Quantum Mechanical Description</h2>

    <p><strong>Nuclear reactions</strong> are interactions between atomic nuclei and particles like neutrons, protons, or alpha particles. These reactions result in the transformation of the nuclei, and their understanding is crucial in fields like nuclear energy and medical treatments.</p>

    <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cross-Section:</strong> The probability that a nuclear reaction will happen when a particle interacts with a nucleus. It's measured in barns (1 barn = 10<sup>-24</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>).</li>
      <li><strong>Reaction Mechanisms:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Direct Reactions:</strong> Occur when a particle directly interacts with the nucleus, leading to an immediate change.</li>
          <li><strong>Compound Nucleus Reactions:</strong> Involve the formation of an intermediate excited nucleus before the reaction proceeds to produce the final products.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Quantum Mechanical Model:</strong> Uses wavefunctions to describe particles and S-matrices to analyze how reactions occur at a quantum level.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example - Neutron Capture Reaction:</h3>
    <p>A neutron can be captured by a nucleus, leading to a nuclear reaction that may result in the fission of the nucleus. For example:</p>
    <pre>¹₁n + ²³⁵₉₂U → ²³⁶₉₂U → Fission Products + Energy</pre>

    <h3>Applications:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nuclear Power:</strong> Understanding these reactions is essential for nuclear reactors that generate power.</li>
      <li><strong>Medical Applications:</strong> Nuclear reactions are used in therapies like cancer radiation treatment and diagnostic imaging (e.g., PET scans).</li>
      <li><strong>Nuclear Fusion:</strong> Research into nuclear fusion, the process that powers the sun, relies on understanding nuclear reactions.</li>
    </ul>
