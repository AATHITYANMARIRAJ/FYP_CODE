            <p>
                Hello, friends. This video on nuclei part one is brought to you by examfeo.com. no more fear from exam topics to
                 be covered in this lesson. Composition of nucleus, size of nucleus. Nuclear binding energy nuclear force radioactivity 
                 alpha decay beta decay gamma decay nuclear fission nuclear reactor nuclear fusion and fusion in stars. So the lesson on 
                 nuclei. So, in our previous lesson, we talked about atoms, right? So now it is time to discuss about the core of the atom, 
                 that is the nucleus. So here you can see on the slide, I have displayed an atom, right, where you have the central positively
                  charged nucleus and the electrons revolving around the nucleus in its orbits, right? So our focus in this lesson is to study 
                  about the composition, the structure of the nucleus, the various properties which are displayed by a nucleus. Nuclear energy, 
                  which has become a very important part of our life because it has become a solution to the present energy crisis. That means we
                   will talk about the energy which we can derive from a nucleus, the interaction between different nuclei. So there are several 
                   things which we are going to discuss here. That is, basically, we are going to focus not on the atom, but only on the nucleus.
                    So to start with, let us talk about the composition of a nucleus. I am sure all of you know that a nucleus consists of protons
                     and neutrons, right? So what are protons? Protons are the positively charged particles which are present inside the nucleus, and neutrons are the neutral particles. So they do not have any charge, right? So there are certain parameters associated with an atom, right. So we will talk about those parameters before we go ahead with this lesson, because these are the basics to understand the things which are there as we go ahead. So the first thing we will talk about is atomic number. When I say, when I talk about any element, it has got an atomic number of its own. I'm very sure you have studied all these things in your chemistry, but still, it is a kind of review. So when I say atomic number, I mean the total number of protons which are present in the nucleus of that atom. So atomic number is the number of protons, right. It is generally denoted by a capital z because we normally follow this representation. So, so that doesn't create confusion. You would see that in most of your textbooks they use this. I mean, they use a capital z to denote atomic number. The next is atomic mass, or which is also known as mass number, like how it is atomic number. Similarly, it is called mass number. So this mass number is nothing but the total number of neutrons and protons. Because, see, this is quite logical. Also, when I talk about the mass of an atom. What does atom consists of? It consists of electron, proton and neutron. We all know that electrons are the lightest particles. They do not have. They have, their mass is very less so. Majorly, the mass of the atom is because of the mass of the nucleus. And nucleus consists of neutrons and protons. So atomic mass or mass number is nothing but the total number of neutrons and protons. So this is known as mass number and it is generally denoted by a capital a. Protons and neutrons are often together called as nucleons. You would see this term being used over and over again in this lesson, because in this lesson we, our focus will only be on the nucleus and the nucleus consists of nucleons. The next thing which we will talk about is the total charge on the nucleus. So we will see that in our next slide before that, since we talked about the representation. So how do we generally represent an element? Let us suppose the general representation is. Let us suppose this is some element x. It has got atomic number z and mass number e. So this is how we generally represent any element. For example, I will give you an example. Let us say I take the example of hydrogen. What is the hydrogen? Atomic number of hydrogen. It is the number of protons present in hydrogen. So how many protons are there in hydrogen? One. What is the mass number of hydrogen? Mass number is the total number of protons and neutrons. In case of hydrogen, we do not have a neutron. So the total number of proton and neutron is also one. So this is how we represent hydrogen. Let us take another example. Let us take the example of carbon. What about carbon? What would be the atomic number of carbon? Atomic number would be the number of protons. How many protons does carbon have? It has six protons. When I talk about carbon, it has got six protons, six electrons and six neutrons. Right? So the atomic number becomes six and the mass number will be number of protons plus number of neutrons. That means six plus six. That is twelve. So this is how we represent carbon. Similarly, if I take the example of oxygen, what happens in case of oxygen? In oxygen, we have eight protons, eight neutrons and eight electrons. Right. However, electron is not playing any role here. Right. Because in this case, atomic number would again be eight and mass number would be eight plus 816. So this is how we represent oxygen. Right. So this is how we represent elements with their atomic number and mass number. So mass number is also sometimes known as atomic mass. Now how do we measure atomic mass? Now, I just kept the charge part on one side as of now, because since we are talking about atomic mass, let us finish this discussion. So how do we measure atomic mass? For example, when you think of mass, what do you, I mean, what comes to your mind? For example, mass reminds you of. I mean, whenever you think of measuring mass, you get some measurement units in your mind, right? For example, kilograms. Grams, right. Because we mostly use these units when we go to a shop and we want to buy some stuff. Say, I want to buy potato. I want to buy two kilos of potato, right? Similarly, sometimes we want to buy 500 grams of potato. Now, all these things which we are talking about are considerably or relatively a greater mass. So here we are using units like kilogram grams and I, etcetera. But when I am talking about atomic mass, I am talking about something whose mass is extremely small when compared to these measurable masses which we see around us. However, for that also, we have employed a different unit to measure it. And this unit is known as the atomic mass unit. So, we have defined this atomic mass unit in a specific way so that we get a convention to measure the masses of atoms which are extremely small values. So this atomic mass unit is generally denoted or represented by a small amu. And it is often referred as amu. We often call this as amu. So how do we define atomic mass unit? It is defined as one by twelve of the mass of the carbon atom. So just now I explained you, right? How do we represent an element? So when I talk about a carbon atom, it is say 612, right? So one by the mass of this carbon atom, whatever is the mass, one by twelve of this mass is defined as 1 amu, right? So how much would be that mass? Let us have a look. So this would mean one by twelve of mass of one carbon atom. So what would be the mass of one carbon atom? Mass of one carbon atom comes out to be 1.992,647 into ten to the power -26 kgs. So just imagine how small is the mass of a carbon when the carbon, when the carbon consists of twelve nucleons, even after that the mass is so less, right? So this comes out to be 1.67 into ten to the power -27 kgs. So we say 1 amu is equal to 1.67 into ten to the power -27 kgs. Because, for example, if I say what would be the atomic mass of nitrogen, what would be the atomic mass of helium? Every time, if we try to represent them in terms of kilograms or grams of, you would get values like this. So that that was not at all convenient, because every time you will have ten to the power -30 ten to the power -27 ten to the power -20 so you'll get that small value, right. Therefore they, I mean, therefore, for better, for easier convention, this atomic mass unit was introduced so that now you can represent everything in terms of amu and it is generally denoted by u. So now we can say that, let us suppose now you will represent things like this, that atomic mass of some element is, let us say, 3.002 amu. So what do you think? Is this a better, an easier representation or is this an easier representation? Obviously this is an easier representation, right? So because of this simplicity, this atomic mass unit became popular. So now this atomic mass unit, I mean, whatever value we get in terms of atomic mass unit, that is not always the exact value because we will calculate it in this way, right? Suppose whatever be the mass of that object, we will convert it into atomic mass units, which is again one by 12th of mass of carbon. Now, for accurate measurement, if we want exact measurement of atomic mass, how do we get that? We get that using an instrument known as mass spectrometer. We will not talk about mass spectrometer now because it is little complicated to understand at your level now. So when you go for your higher studies, you will, you will get to know, you get to use mass spectrometer in your physics laboratories, right? So this is an instrument which is extremely useful for in detecting elements as well. You can detect elements because this instrument helps you to determine the atomic mass of masses of elements and that helps you to identify unknown elements as well. Right? So it has got extremely useful applications and this is how we actually, for accurate measurements of atomic mass, we use this instrument, right? So I hope you are clear with the unit which we use to measure atomic mass. Thank you.
